Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 1 Services Advertising The Company\u2019s advertising services include third-party licensing arrangements and the Company\u2019s own advertising platforms. AppleCare The Company offers a portfolio of fee-based service and support products under the AppleCare \u00ae brand. The offerings provide priority access to Apple technical support, access to the global Apple authorized service network for repair and replacement services, and in many cases additional coverage for instances of accidental damage or theft and loss, depending on the country and type of product.

Digital Content The Company operates various platforms, including the App Store \u00ae , that allow customers to discover and download applications and digital content, such as books, music, video, games and podcasts.

Segments The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Markets and Distribution The Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2 The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s",

In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Human Capital The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately 161,000 full-time equivalent employees. Workplace Practices and Policies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees",

Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company\u2019s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees\u2019 individual growth and development. Inclusion and Diversity The Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.

    "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5 The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations and supply chain and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company\u2019s operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company\u2019s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Many of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the",

Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, and result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. Following an interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. The Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Global markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 6 The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications.

The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company\u2019s products, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 7 The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, armed conflict, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, or international trade disputes. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be reduced or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can",

For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The effects of global or regional economic conditions on the Company\u2019s suppliers, described in \u201c The Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, \u201d above, can also affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. The Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 8 The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence",

Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company\u2019s products. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 9 The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. The Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024.

The Company is also subject to litigation and investigations relating to the App Store, which have resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. This could reduce the volume of sales, and the commission that the Company earns on those sales, would decrease. If the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales is reduced, or if it is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. The Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. Much of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company\u2019s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 10 The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products",

The Company\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information, with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to network and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which could result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of severe diplomatic or armed conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and may be vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 11 Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services. Except as described in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 12, \u201cCommitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations\u201d under the heading \u201cContingencies,\u201d in the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant compensatory, punitive or trebled monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results",

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 12 The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019s supply chain and its business. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\u2019s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company\u2019s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with",

The Company expects to make further business changes in the future, including as a result of legislative initiatives impacting the App Store, such as the EU Digital Markets Act, which the Company is required to comply with by March 2024, or similar laws in other jurisdictions. Changes have included how developers communicate with consumers outside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Future changes could also affect what the Company charges developers for access to its platforms, how it manages distribution of apps outside of the App Store, and how and to what extent it allows developers to communicate with consumers inside the App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 13 The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations result in adverse findings against the Company, the Company could be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make changes to its App Store business, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company is also subject to litigation relating to the App Store, which has resulted in changes to the Company\u2019s business practices, and may in the future result in further changes. Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. There can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings could negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. The Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with other federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines.

Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 14 Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with higher cost structures. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners. The Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors.

    "text": "currency\u2013denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Therefore, although the Company has not realized any significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 15 The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. General Risks The price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility. The Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors, and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.",

    "text": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cDistrict Court\u201d) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. On September 10, 2021, the District Court ruled in favor of the Company with respect to nine out of the ten counts included in Epic\u2019s claim. The District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On April 24, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (the \u201cCircuit Court\u201d) affirmed the District Court\u2019s ruling. On June 7, 2023, the Company and Epic filed petitions with the Circuit Court requesting further review of the decision. On June 30, 2023, the Circuit Court denied both petitions. On July 17, 2023, the Circuit Court granted Apple\u2019s motion to stay enforcement of the injunction pending appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If the U.S. Supreme Court denies Apple\u2019s petition, the stay of the injunction will expire. Masimo Masimo Corporation and Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (together, \u201cMasimo\u201d) filed a complaint before the U.S. International Trade Commission (the \u201cITC\u201d) alleging infringement by the Company of five patents relating to the functionality of the blood oxygen feature in Apple Watch Series 6 and 7. In its complaint, Masimo sought a permanent exclusion order prohibiting importation to the United States of certain Apple Watch models that include blood oxygen sensing functionality. On October 26, 2023, the ITC entered a limited exclusion order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) prohibiting importation and sales in the United States of Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing functionality, which includes Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The Order will not go into effect until the end of the administrative review period, which is currently expected to end on December 25, 2023. The Company intends to appeal the Order and seek a stay pending the appeal. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2023 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company also utilized the final $4.6 billion under its previous repurchase program, which was most recently authorized in April 2022. The programs do not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. Under the programs, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act. (2) In August 2023, the Company entered into new accelerated share repurchase agreements (\u201cASRs\u201d). Under the terms of the ASRs, two financial institutions committed to deliver shares of the Company\u2019s common stock during the purchase periods in exchange for up-front payments totaling $5.0 billion. The total number of shares ultimately delivered under the ASRs, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company\u2019s common stock during the ASRs\u2019 purchase periods, which end in the first quarter of 2024.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2023 and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. Discussions of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021 are not included, and can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022. Fiscal Period The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Fiscal Year Highlights The Company\u2019s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023. The Company\u2019s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services. The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2023 included the following: First Quarter 2023: \u2022 iPad and iPad Pro; \u2022 Next-generation Apple TV 4K; and \u2022 MLS Season Pass, a Major League Soccer subscription streaming service.

Fourth Quarter 2023: \u2022 iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max; and \u2022 Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2. In May 2023, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $90 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.23 to $0.24 per share beginning in May 2023. During 2023, the Company repurchased $76.6 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.0 billion. Macroeconomic Conditions Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, changes in interest rates, and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.

The Company\u2019s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 Change 2022 Change 2021 Research and development $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 20 % $ 21,914 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 7 % 6 % Selling, general and administrative $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 14 % $ 21,973 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 6 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 17 % $ 43,887 Percentage of total net sales 14 % 13 % 12 % Research and Development The year-over-year growth in R&D expense in 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expense was relatively flat in 2023 compared to 2022. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 23 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2023, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Provision for income taxes $ 16,741 $ 19,300 $ 14,527 Effective tax rate 14.7 % 16.2 % 13.3 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2023 and 2022 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by state income taxes. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2023 was lower compared to 2022 due primarily to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings and the impact of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2022, partially offset by lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents and unrestricted marketable securities, which totaled $148.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company\u2019s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: Debt As of September 30, 2023, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $106.6 billion (collectively the \u201cNotes\u201d), with $9.9 billion payable within",

Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $41.1 billion, with $2.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company also issues unsecured short-term promissory notes pursuant to a commercial paper program. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $6.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was payable within 12 months. Leases The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had fixed lease payment obligations of $15.8 billion, with $2.0 billion payable within 12 months. Manufacturing Purchase Obligations The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture subassemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. The Company also obtains individual components for its products from a wide variety of individual suppliers. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had manufacturing purchase obligations of $53.1 billion, with $52.9 billion payable within 12 months. The Company\u2019s manufacturing purchase obligations are primarily noncancelable. Other Purchase Obligations The Company\u2019s other purchase obligations primarily consist of noncancelable obligations to acquire capital assets, including assets related to product manufacturing, and noncancelable obligations related to supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had other purchase obligations of $21.9 billion, with $5.6 billion payable within 12 months. Deemed Repatriation Tax Payable As of September 30, 2023, the balance of the deemed repatriation tax payable imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cAct\u201d) was $22.0 billion, with $6.5 billion expected to be paid within 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 24 Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 30, 2023, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.24 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the Act and matters related to the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that which is reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.

    "text": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Interest Rate Risk The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios. The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 (dollars in millions): Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase Potential Impact 2023 2022 Investment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 3,089 $ 4,022 Term debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 194 $ 201 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost. The Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $669 million and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 33 Note 2 \u2013 Revenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud \u00ae , Siri \u00ae and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.

The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument\u2019s underlying contractual maturity date. Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency transactions is 19 years. The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 74,730 $ 102,670 Interest rate contracts $ 19,375 $ 20,125 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 104,777 $ 185,381 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 37 The gross fair values of the Company\u2019s derivative assets and liabilities as of September 24, 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2022 Fair Value of Derivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges Fair Value of Derivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges Total Fair Value Derivative assets (1) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 4,317 $ 2,819 $ 7,136 Derivative liabilities (2) : Foreign exchange contracts $ 2,205 $ 2,547 $ 4,752 Interest rate contracts $ 1,367 $ \u2014 $ 1,367 (1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The derivative assets above represent the Company\u2019s gross credit exposure if all counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally uses collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally uses master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, under which the Company is allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of set-off associated with the Company\u2019s derivative contracts, including the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $ 7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of $ 412 million.

The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company.

Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 41 European Commission State Aid Decision On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the \u201cState Aid Decision\u201d). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac 13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac 1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice (the \u201cECJ\u201d) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024. The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision. On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was \u20ac 12.7 billion, excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion of all legal proceedings.

The total shares withheld were approximately 37 million, 41 million and 53 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company\u2019s closing stock price.

Note 12 \u2013 Commitments, Contingencies and Supply Concentrations Unconditional Purchase Obligations The Company has entered into certain off\u2013balance sheet commitments that require the future purchase of goods or services (\u201cunconditional purchase obligations\u201d). The Company\u2019s unconditional purchase obligations primarily consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, and distribution rights. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 30, 2023, are as follows (in millions): 2024 $ 4,258 2025 2,674 2026 3,434 2027 1,277 2028 5,878 Thereafter 3,215 Total $ 20,736 Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product Although most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 46 Note 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information. The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Americas: Net sales $ 162,560 $ 169,658 $ 153,306 Operating income $ 60,508 $ 62,683 $ 53,382 Europe: Net sales $ 94,294 $ 95,118 $ 89,307 Operating income $ 36,098 $ 35,233 $ 32,505 Greater China: Net sales $ 72,559 $ 74,200 $ 68,366 Operating income $ 30,328 $ 31,153 $ 28,504 Japan: Net sales $ 24,257 $ 25,977 $ 28,482 Operating income $ 11,888 $ 12,257 $ 12,798 Rest of Asia Pacific: Net sales $ 29,615 $ 29,375 $ 26,356 Operating income $ 12,066 $ 11,569 $ 9,817 A reconciliation of the Company\u2019s segment operating income to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2023, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (in millions): 2023 2022 2021 Segment operating income $ 150,888 $ 152,895 $ 137,006 Research and development expense ( 29,915 ) ( 26,251 ) ( 21,914 ) Other corporate expenses, net (1) (",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apple Inc. at September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of Apple Inc.\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, Apple Inc. is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 19.5 billion, of which $ 9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact Apple Inc.\u2019s effective tax rate.

In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, Apple Inc. uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 49 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management\u2019s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions, and the development of the related disclosures. To evaluate Apple Inc.\u2019s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, Apple Inc.\u2019s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of Apple Inc.\u2019s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For certain tax positions, we also received external legal counsel confirmation letters and discussed the matters with external advisors and Apple Inc. tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated Apple Inc.\u2019s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as Apple Inc.\u2019s auditor since 2009. San Jose, California November 2, 2023 Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the \u201cCOSO criteria\u201d). In our opinion, Apple Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc. as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated November 2, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion Apple Inc.\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Apple Inc. in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

    "text": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2023, which were identified in connection with management\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.

Segments The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Markets and Distribution The Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2024, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 38% and 62%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive, and are characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2 The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation. The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources,",

Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 2 The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services.

The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company\u2019s services compete with business models that provide content to users for free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, accessories, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 3 Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Human Capital The Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all of its team members, so that its people can do the best work of their lives. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time",

As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees. Compensation and Benefits The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the Company\u2019s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away. Growth and Development The Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development, as well as learning opportunities to support their well-being. Workplace Practices and Policies The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. Inclusion and Diversity The Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees. Engagement The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity. Health and Safety The Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers through its global security team.

    "text": "Item 1A. Risk Factors The Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 5 The Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost of the Company\u2019s products and the components and raw materials that go into them, and can require the Company to take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships and operations, and ceasing to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers. Changing the Company\u2019s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions affecting the Company\u2019s business. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. Many of the Company\u2019s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company\u2019s and its suppliers\u2019 operations and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. For example, global supply chains can be highly concentrated and geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, increase",

Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, increase the Company\u2019s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. The Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. Following any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, experience significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 6 Global markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets characterized by aggressive price competition and resulting downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces substantial competition in these markets from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and digital content supplier relationships. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. The Company\u2019s services also face substantial competition, including from companies that have significant resources and experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to",

The Company competes with business models that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition depend substantially on the Company\u2019s ability to continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively. Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software or other third-party support for the Company\u2019s products and services, the effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality or other defects or deficiencies. New products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins, which can materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 7 The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and a significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company relies on single-source outsourcing partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on outsourcing partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. Any failure of these partners to perform can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s cost or supply of components or finished goods. In addition, manufacturing or logistics in these locations or transit to final destinations can be disrupted for a variety of reasons, including natural and man-made disasters, information technology system failures, commercial disputes, economic, business, labor, environmental, public health or political issues, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, or conflict. The Company has invested in manufacturing process equipment, much of which is held at certain of its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments to certain of its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply of components and finished goods, if these outsourcing partners or suppliers experience severe financial problems or other disruptions in their business, such continued supply can be disrupted or terminated, and the recoverability of manufacturing process equipment or prepayments can be negatively impacted. Changes or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks. Future operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the",

Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components, there can be no assurance the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. In addition, component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead to business failure for the supplier or consolidation within a particular industry, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, can be affected for any number of reasons, including if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. When the Company\u2019s supply of components for a new or existing product has been delayed or constrained, or when an outsourcing partner has delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays or constraints could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business and financial performance could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 8 The Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers. Failure to do so can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user\u2019s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand, or for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair",

If the Company determines that an impairment has occurred, it records a write-down equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can be no assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The Company\u2019s products and services are designed to include intellectual property owned by third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, the Company\u2019s products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents or intellectual property rights of others. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. Based on experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses to such third-party intellectual property can generally be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. However, there can be no assurance the necessary licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services, or otherwise have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 9 The Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. There can be no assurance third-party developers will continue to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products. The Company believes the availability of third-party software applications and services for its products depends in part on the developers\u2019 perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company\u2019s products. The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with",

The Company distributes third-party applications for its products through the App Store. For the vast majority of applications, developers keep all of the revenue they generate on the App Store. Where applicable, the Company retains a commission from sales of applications and sales of digital services or goods initiated within an application. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its products and services, including taking actions in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements, and expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms. The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari \u00ae in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (the \u201cDMA\u201d), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company\u2019s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces (\u201cAPIs\u201d) for developers. Changes to the Company\u2019s products and services could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including if such business changes result in reduced App Store or other sales, reductions in the rate of the commission that the Company retains on such sales, or if the rate of the commission is otherwise narrowed in scope or eliminated. Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers. Some third-party digital content providers require the Company to provide digital rights management and other security solutions. If requirements change, the Company may have to develop or license new technology to provide these solutions. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to develop or license such solutions at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 10 The Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. Much of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. In addition to intense competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving. If the Company does not manage changing workforce dynamics effectively, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s culture, reputation and operational flexibility. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company depends on the performance of carriers, wholesalers, retailers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. The Company also sells its products and services and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. Some carriers providing cellular network service for the Company\u2019s products offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of the device. There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays.",

There can be no assurance such offers will be continued at all or in the same amounts. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, and improving product placement displays. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. The financial condition of these resellers could weaken, these resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products. The Company\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal information with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 11 The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks seek to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information or disrupt normal business operations, and can, among other things, impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, impact the Company\u2019s stock price, materially damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, which can result in penalties, fines or judgments against the Company. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. The Company has implemented systems and processes intended to secure its information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive data, and mitigate the impact of unauthorized access, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies. As with all companies, these security measures may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its suppliers\u2019 and other third parties\u2019 employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or such suppliers\u2019 or third parties\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Investment in new business strategies and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies or acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Investment and acquisition transactions are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. These new ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The failure of any significant investment could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s retail stores are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019s retail operations are subject to many factors that pose risks and uncertainties and could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including macroeconomic factors that could have an adverse effect on general retail activity. Other factors include the Company\u2019s ability to: manage costs associated with retail store construction and operation; manage relationships with existing retail partners; manage costs associated with fluctuations in the value of retail inventory; and obtain and renew leases in quality retail locations at a reasonable cost. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 12 Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions which can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its cellular-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology and other patent-holding companies frequently assert their patents and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. There can be no assurance such agreements can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These agreements can also significantly increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses and require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services. The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company, and has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.

While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations on subjects, including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws and regulations can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019s business or supply chain. New and changing laws and regulations can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. These risks and costs may increase as the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance the Company\u2019s employees, contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or the Company\u2019s policies and procedures. If the Company is found to have violated laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 13 Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. Although the Company has programs, policies and procedures in place that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements, there can be no assurance that such policies and procedures will be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations and related reporting obligations expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights, and diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, the Company makes statements about its goals and initiatives through its various non-financial reports, information provided on its website, press statements and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of the Company\u2019s announced goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\u2019s control. The Company cannot guarantee that it will achieve its announced environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with the Company\u2019s goals and initiatives. Any failure, or perceived failure, by the Company to achieve its goals, further its initiatives, adhere to its public statements, comply with federal, state and international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its App Store, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S. the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the",

The Company has also implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari in the EU as it seeks to comply with the DMA, including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company\u2019s operating systems, and additional tools and APIs for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the European Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d). Although the Company\u2019s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA\u2019s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance, and other jurisdictions may seek to require the Company to make changes to its business. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain. The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC and other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 14 There can be no assurance the Company\u2019s business will not be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with other legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security and otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, and lost sales. The Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding data protection. The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal information among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal information through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations",

Any failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries or proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others. In addition to reputational impacts, penalties could include ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personal information, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health data, financial data and biometric data. Health data and financial data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, or if health data or financial data is handled in a manner not permitted by law or under the Company\u2019s agreements with healthcare or financial institutions, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, and can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can also incur significant fees or fines. Payment card data is also subject to additional requirements. Under payment card rules and obligations, if cardholder information is potentially compromised, the Company can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines if the Company fails to follow payment card industry data security standards. The Company could also experience a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards if it fails to follow payment card industry data security standards, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. Financial Risks The Company expects its quarterly net sales and results of operations to fluctuate. The Company\u2019s profit margins vary across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels. For example, the gross margins on the Company\u2019s products and services vary significantly and can change over time. The Company\u2019s gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact quarterly net sales. The Company could also be subject to unexpected developments, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for the Company\u2019s products or services, issues with new product or service introductions, information technology system failures or network disruptions, or failure of one of the Company\u2019s logistics, supply or manufacturing partners. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 15 The Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain",

Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets and its ability to mitigate such risks may be limited. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 28, 2024, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses. The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 16 The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. General Risks The price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility. The Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time.

Cybersecurity The Company\u2019s management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for identifying, assessing and managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company\u2019s Head of Corporate Information Security leads a dedicated Information Security team of highly skilled individuals with experience across industries that, among other things, develops and distributes information security policies, standards and procedures; engages in employee cybersecurity training; implements security controls; assesses security risk and compliance posture; monitors and responds to security events; and executes security testing and assessments. The Company\u2019s Head of Corporate Information Security has extensive knowledge and skills gained from over 25 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, including serving in leadership positions at other large technology companies and leading the Company\u2019s Information Security team since 2016. The Company\u2019s Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and manage security incidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of its security processes and incident response. A dedicated Supplier Trust team manages information security risks the Company is exposed to through its supplier relationships. The Company has processes to log, track, address, and escalate for further assessment and report, as appropriate, cybersecurity incidents across the Company and its suppliers to senior management and the Audit and Finance Committee (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d) of the Board. The Company\u2019s enterprise risk management program is designed to identify, asse ss, and monitor the Company\u2019s business risks, including financial, operational, compliance and reputational risks, and reflects management\u2019s assessment of cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee regularly reviews and discusses the Company\u2019s cybersecurity risks with management, including the Company\u2019s Head of Corporate Information Security, its General Counsel and the Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business Assurance, and Internal Audit, and receives updates, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents. The Chair of the Audit Committee regularly reports the substance of such reviews and discussions to the Board, as necessary, and recommends to the Board such actions as the Audit Committee deems appropriate.

    "text": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings Digital Markets Act Investigations On March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened two formal noncompliance investigations against the Company under the DMA. The Commission\u2019s investigations concern (1) Article 5(4) of the DMA, which relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users; and (2) Article 6(3) of the DMA, which relates to default settings, uninstallation of apps, and a web browser choice screen on iOS. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced its preliminary findings in the Article 5(4) investigation alleging that the Company\u2019s App Store rules are in breach of the DMA and announced that it had opened a third formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company\u2019s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA. If the Commission makes a final determination that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company\u2019s annual worldwide net sales. Although any decision by the Commission can be appealed to the General Court of the EU, the effectiveness of the Commission\u2019s order would apply immediately while the appeal is pending, unless a stay of the order is granted. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Department of Justice Lawsuit On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself. Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. (\u201cEpic\u201d) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the \u201cCalifornia District Court\u201d) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Store Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps external links that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than Apple in-app purchasing. The injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. A motion by Epic disputing the Company\u2019s compliance plan and seeking to enforce the injunction, which the Company has opposed, is pending before the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the injunction. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",

The Company\u2019s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure. Operating Expenses Operating expenses for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2024 Change 2023 Change 2022 Research and development $ 31,370 5 % $ 29,915 14 % $ 26,251 Percentage of total net sales 8 % 8 % 7 % Selling, general and administrative $ 26,097 5 % $ 24,932 (1) % $ 25,094 Percentage of total net sales 7 % 7 % 6 % Total operating expenses $ 57,467 5 % $ 54,847 7 % $ 51,345 Percentage of total net sales 15 % 14 % 13 % Research and Development The growth in R&D expense during 2024 compared to 2023 was driven primarily by increases in headcount-related expenses.

Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 24 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2024 2023 2022 Provision for income taxes $ 29,749 $ 16,741 $ 19,300 Effective tax rate 24.1 % 14.7 % 16.2 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher than the statutory federal income tax rate due primarily to a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and state income taxes, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2024 was higher compared to 2023 due primarily to a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and lower tax benefits from share-based compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company believes its balances of unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which totaled $140.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy its cash requirements and capital return program over the next 12 months and beyond. The Company\u2019s material cash requirements include the following contractual obligations: Debt As of September 28, 2024, the Company had outstanding fixed-rate notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $97.3 billion (collectively the \u201cNotes\u201d), with $10.9 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with the Notes total $38.5 billion, with $2.6 billion payable within 12 months.

The funds necessary to settle the obligation were held in escrow as of September 28, 2024, and restricted from general use. Capital Return Program In addition to its contractual cash requirements, the Company has an authorized share repurchase program. The program does not obligate the Company to acquire a minimum amount of shares. As of September 28, 2024, the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend was $0.25 per share. The Company intends to increase its dividend on an annual basis, subject to declaration by the Board. In May 2024, the Company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $110 billion and raised its quarterly dividend from $0.24 to $0.25 per share beginning in May 2024. During 2024, the Company repurchased $95.0 billion of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $15.2 billion. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Income Taxes In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-09\u201d), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method. Segment Reporting In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-07\u201d), which will require the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d). In addition, ASU 2023-07 will require the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-07 in its fourth quarter of 2025 using a retrospective transition method. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.

    "text": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Interest Rate Risk The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios. The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (dollars in millions): Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase Potential Impact 2024 2023 Investment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 2,755 $ 3,089 Term debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 139 $ 194 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost. The Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $538 million and $669 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2024 and 2022 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Revenue The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities.

Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 34 Note 2 \u2013 Revenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud \u00ae , Siri \u00ae and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains. Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows (in millions): 2024 2023 2022 iPhone $ 201,183 $ 200,583 $ 205,489 Mac 29,984 29,357 40,177 iPad 26,694 28,300 29,292 Wearables, Home and Accessories 37,005 39,845 41,241 Services (1) 96,169 85,200 78,129 Total net sales $ 391,035 $ 383,285 $ 394,328 (1) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products. Total net sales include $ 7.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2024 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023, $ 8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, and $ 7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 35 The Company\u2019s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, \u201cSegment Information and Geographic Data\u201d for 2024, 2023 and 2022, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 12.8 billion and $ 12.1 billion, respectively. As of September 28, 2024, the Company expects 64 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 25 %",

The Company\u2019s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument\u2019s underlying maturity. Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 37 To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 28, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency transactions is 18 years. The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. The notional amounts of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions): 2024 2023 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 64,069 $ 74,730 Interest rate contracts $ 14,575 $ 19,375 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 91,493 $ 104,777 The carrying amounts of the Company\u2019s hedged items in fair value hedges as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows (in millions): 2024 2023 Hedged assets/(liabilities): Current and non-current marketable securities $ \u2014 $ 14,433 Current and non-current term debt $ ( 13,505 ) $ ( 18,247 ) Accounts Receivable Trade Receivables The Company\u2019s third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 38 % and 41 % of total trade receivables as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers to limit credit risk. Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac 13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac 1.2 billion. From time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. As of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of \u20ac 12.7 billion plus interest of \u20ac 1.2 billion was held in escrow and restricted from general use. The total balance of the escrow, including net unrealized investment gains, was \u20ac 14.2 billion or $ 15.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, of which $ 2.6 billion was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $ 13.2 billion was classified as current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 4, \u201cFinancial Instruments\u201d for more information. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 39 The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice (the \u201cECJ\u201d) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. On September 10, 2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the Commission\u2019s 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $ 10.2 billion, net, which represents $ 15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of the escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $ 4.8 billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $ 823 million.

A valuation allowance has been recorded for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other temporary differences. Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 22.0 billion, of which $ 10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 19.5 billion, of which $ 9.5 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (in millions): 2024 2023 2022 Beginning balances $ 19,454 $ 16,758 $ 15,477 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 1,727 2,044 2,284 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year ( 386 ) ( 1,463 ) ( 1,982 ) Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 2,542 2,628 1,936 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 1,070 ) ( 19 ) ( 28 ) Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 229 ) ( 494 ) ( 929 ) Ending balances $ 22,038 $ 19,454 $ 16,758 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions.

Altho ugh the timing of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between approximately $ 5 billion and $ 13 billion in the next 12 months, primarily related to intercompany transfer pricing and deemed repatriation tax.

Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 44 Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company\u2019s RSU activity and related information for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per RSU Aggregate Fair Value (in millions) Balance as of September 25, 2021 240,427 $ 75.16 RSUs granted 91,674 $ 150.70 RSUs vested ( 115,861 ) $ 72.12 RSUs canceled ( 14,739 ) $ 99.77 Balance as of September 24, 2022 201,501 $ 109.48 RSUs granted 88,768 $ 150.87 RSUs vested ( 101,878 ) $ 97.31 RSUs canceled ( 8,144 ) $ 127.98 Balance as of September 30, 2023 180,247 $ 135.91 RSUs granted 80,456 $ 173.78 RSUs vested ( 87,633 ) $ 127.59 RSUs canceled ( 9,744 ) $ 140.80 Balance as of September 28, 2024 163,326 $ 158.73 $ 37,204 The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $ 15.8 billion, $ 15.9 billion and $ 18.2 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees\u2019 obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately 31 million, 37 million and 41 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the Company\u2019s closing stock price. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees\u2019 tax obligations were $ 5.6 billion in both 2024 and 2023 and $ 6.4 billion in 2022.

Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements. Substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Note 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.

Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 48 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management\u2019s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures. We evaluated the Company\u2019s assessment of which tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained and the related measurement of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Our audit procedures included, among others, reading and evaluating management\u2019s assumptions and analysis, and, as applicable, the Company\u2019s communications with taxing authorities, that detailed the basis and technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. We involved our tax subject matter resources in assessing the technical merits of certain of the Company\u2019s tax positions based on our knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with related taxing authorities. For a certain tax position, we also received an external legal counsel confirmation letter and discussed the matter with external advisors and the Company\u2019s tax personnel. In addition, we evaluated the Company\u2019s disclosure in relation to these matters included in Note 7 to the financial statements. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2009.

Basis for Opinion The Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California November 1, 2024 Apple Inc. | 2024 Form 10-K | 50",

    "text": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024, which were identified in connection with management\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.

Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. Markets and Distribution The Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company sells its services in the same markets through its various service platforms. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers, for the sale of its products and certain of its services. During 2025, the Company\u2019s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 40% and 60%, respectively, of total net sales. Competition The markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. The markets in which the Company competes are further defined by frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2 The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative price and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party software and accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to effectively protect and enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights. The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services.

Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2 The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace.

The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories, and services. The Company\u2019s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings with large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large customer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. Supply of Components Although most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\u2019s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them. The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Research and Development Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing products and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Intellectual Property The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, software and services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel. The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its hardware, software and service research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of applications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 3 In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company\u2019s products and services include technology or intellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all.

While the Company has generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future on reasonable terms or at all. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction. Human Capital The Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best talent. The Company works to create a culture of collaboration, one where people with a broad range of backgrounds and perspectives can come together to innovate and do the best work of their lives. The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. As of September 27, 2025, the Company had approximately 166,000 full-time equivalent employees. The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and offers discretionary cash and equity awards to enable employees to share in the Company\u2019s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away. The Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs through Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can also take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development. The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusion. The Company is committed to the safety and security of its team members everywhere it operates. The Company supports employees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those working in potentially high-hazard environments.

The Company may not be able to accurately predict, control or mitigate these risks. Statements in this section are based on the Company\u2019s beliefs and opinions regarding matters that could materially adversely affect the Company in the future and are not representations as to whether such matters have or have not occurred previously. The risks and uncertainties described below are not exhaustive and should not be considered a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties that the Company faces or may face in the future. This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks The Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales. In addition, the Company\u2019s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company\u2019s supplier facilities, including manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company\u2019s operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset values, and other economic factors. Uncertainty about, or a decline in, global or regional economic conditions can also have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency. Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced liquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments. These and other impacts can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 5 The Company\u2019s business can be impacted by political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions. Political events, trade and other international disputes, geopolitical tensions, conflict, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions can have a material adverse effect on the Company and its customers, employees, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners. The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company\u2019s total net sales, and the Company believes that it generally benefits from growth in international trade. A significant majority of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and supply chain. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\u2019s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the Company to change suppliers, restructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected products, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing the Company\u2019s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Trade and other international disputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from such measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could result in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S. (\u201cU.S. Tariffs\u201d), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors.",

The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and restrictive. Many of the Company\u2019s operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers and contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In addition, the Company\u2019s and its suppliers\u2019 operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\u2019s control. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s service offerings, increase the Company\u2019s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas. The Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While the Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays in production ramps of new products and development of new services. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 6 Following any interruption to its business, the Company can require substantial recovery time, incur significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Global markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets. The Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by aggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These markets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the Company must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve expected returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual property rights. Regulatory requirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or modify its products and services for, certain countries and limit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its intellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these outcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s",

Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these outcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to register, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if competitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be materially adversely affected. The Company\u2019s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large customer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall. If the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially adversely affected. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7 Business Risks To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions of products and services. Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, navigate global regulatory requirements and barriers to market access, and successfully manage the transition to these new and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain highly skilled personnel to execute on its strategic initiatives, and the timely and successful development and market acceptance of new products, services and technologies. Success also relies on the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp-up issues, the effective integration of third-party services and technologies into the Company\u2019s products and services, the availability, delivery and performance of application software or other third-party support for the Company\u2019s products and services, the effective management of manufacturing and other purchase commitments and the management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and the availability of products in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand. Additionally, quality issues or other defects or deficiencies can adversely affect the success of new product and service introductions and market acceptance. New products, services and technologies may replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins. The Company may not be able to successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services, which can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S. A significant majority of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in the U.S. The Company relies on single-source partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many components, and on partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware products. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the cost, quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from",

Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Changes or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks. Future operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the past experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future. Additionally, the Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 8 The Company\u2019s products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can be affected by design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist in components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s products unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the Company\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings can have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the Company\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users to harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. The Company may not be able to detect and fix all issues and defects in the hardware, software and services it offers, which can result in widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company\u2019s products and services. Errors, bugs and vulnerabilities can be exploited by third parties, compromising the safety and security of a user\u2019s device. In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product replacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service introductions and lost sales. The Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records a write-down for product and component inventories if cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company reviews other assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities, inventory prepayments and other long-lived assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory",

The Company reviews other assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities, inventory prepayments and other long-lived assets, for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets are currently recoverable, the Company may incur write-downs, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components or products, or not fully utilize purchase commitments. The Company accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of excess products and components. The Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The Company\u2019s products and services include technology or intellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. In addition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may compete, current extensive intellectual property coverage and the rapid rate of new intellectual property rights generation, the Company\u2019s products and services may be alleged to infringe existing intellectual property rights of others. This risk may be exacerbated by the use of new and emerging technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can involve, among other things, the acquisition and use of copyrighted materials for training as well as the potential reproduction of copyrighted materials in their outputs . From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain intellectual property rights of third parties. The Company is not always able to obtain all necessary licenses to third-party intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual property, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain products, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services and expose the Company to significant licensing costs, all of which can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 9 The Company\u2019s future performance depends in part on support from third-party software developers. The Company believes decisions by customers to purchase its hardware products depend in part on the availability of third-party software applications and services. Third-party developers may discontinue the development and maintenance of software applications and services for the Company\u2019s products. If third-party software applications and services cease to be developed and maintained for the Company\u2019s products, customers may choose not to buy the Company\u2019s products, adversely impacting the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company believes that third-party developer support depends on the perceived benefits of creating software and services for the Company\u2019s products compared to competitors\u2019 platforms, such as Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may be based on factors such as the market position of the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may be generated, expected future growth of product sales, and the costs of developing such applications and services. The Company\u2019s minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets can make developers less inclined to develop or upgrade software for the Company\u2019s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for competitors\u2019 products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts on these competing platforms, the availability and quality of applications for the Company\u2019s devices can suffer. The Company relies on the continued availability and development of compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company\u2019s products and operating systems are subject to rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable to or choose not to keep up with this pace of change, their applications can fail to take advantage of these changes to deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result in dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company\u2019s products. Failure to obtain or create digital content that appeals to the Company\u2019s customers, or to make such content available on commercially reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company contracts with numerous third parties to offer their digital content to customers. This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services.

This includes the right to sell, or offer subscriptions to, third-party content, as well as the right to incorporate specific content into the Company\u2019s own services. The licensing or other distribution arrangements for this content can be for relatively short time periods and do not guarantee the continuation or renewal of these arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Some third-party content providers and distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may seek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a wide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules. The Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for talent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers. The Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and availability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and inclusive culture. Much of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and service of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced personnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley, where most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. Periods of intense competition for talent in particular fields can lead to increased costs as the Company seeks to offer competitive compensation to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. In addition to competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving and the Company must navigate changes effectively in order to achieve its strategic initiatives. Laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws and export controls, among others, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain a highly skilled, global workforce. If the Company does not effectively manage changing workforce dynamics and regulatory requirements, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s culture, operational flexibility, strategy and costs, all of which can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company believes that its distinctive and inclusive culture is a significant driver of its success. If the Company is unable to nurture its culture, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees who are critical to its success, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 10 The Company depends on the performance of carriers and other resellers. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through cellular network carriers and other resellers, many of which distribute products and services from competitors. Resellers offer financing, installment payment plans or subsidies for users\u2019 purchases of devices, and such plans may be discontinued or modified any time. The Company has invested and will continue to invest in programs to enhance reseller sales, including staffing selected resellers\u2019 stores with Company employees and contractors, improving product placement displays, and developing and making digital marketing assets available to resellers. These programs can require a substantial investment while not assuring return or incremental sales. For example, the purchasing preferences and behaviors of consumers may change, the financial condition of resellers could weaken, resellers could stop distributing the Company\u2019s products, or uncertainty regarding demand for some or all of the Company\u2019s products could cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company\u2019s products, all of which could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company\u2019s business and reputation are impacted by information technology system failures and network disruptions. The Company and its global supply chain are dependent on complex information technology systems and are exposed to information technology system failures or network disruptions caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, ransomware or other cybersecurity incidents, or other events or disruptions. System upgrades, redundancy and other continuity measures may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 business continuity and disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.

Such failures or disruptions can adversely impact the Company\u2019s business by, among other things, preventing access to the Company\u2019s online services, interfering with customer transactions or impeding the manufacturing and shipping of the Company\u2019s products. These events could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information, including personal information, could subject the Company to significant reputational, financial, legal and operational consequences. The Company\u2019s business requires it to use and store confidential information, including personal and sensitive health and financial information with respect to the Company\u2019s customers and employees. The Company devotes significant resources to systems and data security, including through the use of encryption and other security measures intended to protect its systems and data. But these measures cannot provide absolute security, and losses or unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information occur and could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company\u2019s business also requires it to share confidential information with suppliers and other third parties. The Company relies on global suppliers that are also exposed to ransomware and other malicious attacks that can disrupt business operations. Although the Company takes steps to secure confidential information that is provided to or accessible by third parties working on the Company\u2019s behalf, such measures are not always effective and losses or unauthorized access to, or releases of, confidential information occur. Such incidents and other malicious attacks could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company experiences malicious attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to its systems on a regular basis. These attacks target the confidentiality, integrity or availability of confidential information and may disrupt normal business operations. Attacks can impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers for its products and services, affect its stock price, damage commercial relationships, and expose the Company to litigation or government investigations, potentially resulting in penalties, fines or judgments. Globally, attacks are expected to continue accelerating in both frequency and sophistication with increasing use by actors of tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, all of which hinders the Company\u2019s ability to identify, investigate and recover from incidents. In addition, attacks against the Company and its customers can escalate during periods of geopolitical tensions or conflict. Although malicious attacks perpetrated to gain access to confidential information, including personal information, affect many companies across various industries, the Company is at a relatively greater risk of being targeted because of its high profile and the value of the confidential information it creates, owns, manages, stores and processes. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 11 As with all companies, the security the Company has implemented may not be sufficient for all eventualities and are vulnerable to hacking, ransomware attacks, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities. For example, third parties can fraudulently induce the Company\u2019s or its suppliers\u2019 and other third parties\u2019 employees or customers into disclosing usernames, passwords or other sensitive information, which can, in turn, be used for unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s or such suppliers\u2019 or third parties\u2019 systems and services. To help protect customers and the Company, the Company deploys and makes available technologies like multifactor authentication, monitors its services and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances, which, among other things, can result in the delay or loss of customer orders or impede customer access to the Company\u2019s products and services. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of data security risks, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Investment in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions could disrupt the Company\u2019s ongoing business, present risks not originally contemplated, and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition. The Company has invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies, commercial relationships and acquisitions. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater-than-expected liabilities and expenses, economic, political, legal and regulatory challenges associated with operating in new businesses, regions or countries, inadequate return on capital, potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets, and significant write-offs. Some transactions, including investments and acquisitions, are exposed to additional risks, including failing to obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, a counterparty\u2019s failure to perform or deliver as anticipated, or the imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit the Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction.

New business strategies and ventures are inherently risky and may not be successful. The Company\u2019s business strategies and investments may not be successful, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Legal and Regulatory Compliance Risks The Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable results of legal proceedings or government investigations. The Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, the Company enters into agreements that include indemnification provisions that can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving the Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased over time and may continue to increase. The Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its standards-enabled products, and new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology, data and other intellectual property asset\u2013holding companies frequently assert their intellectual property rights and seek royalties and often enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. These risks, and the risks of novel claims being attempted, may be exacerbated as new and emerging technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, are further integrated into the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company is vigorously defending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages. Regardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company may enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. However, such agreements may not always be available on acceptable terms, and litigation may still arise. Such agreements can also significantly reduce the Company\u2019s revenue and increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses, materially adversely affecting the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Additionally, such agreements may require the Company to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 12 The outcome of litigation or government investigations is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company or an indemnified third party in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. Further, such an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the Company. Adverse resolution of legal matters has from time to time required, and can in the future require, the Company to change its business practices. It can also limit the Company\u2019s ability to enjoin others from using, or to derive value from, its intellectual property rights, and to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and services, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. The Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide on subjects including antitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; online safety; age verification; consumer protection; advertising, sales, billing and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement; digital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media, television, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment; anticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering; foreign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste, recycling, product design and climate change. Compliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting the Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u2019s products and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the Company\u2019s business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied.

If the Company is found to have violated such laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Risks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities increase as the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or as the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must navigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies. Regulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. The Company\u2019s programs, policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the Company\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Varied stakeholder expectations about social and other issues expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business. Various stakeholders, including governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and others, have differing expectations about a wide range of social and other issues related to the Company\u2019s business. The Company makes statements about its values, including the environmental and societal impact of its business, through various reports, information provided on the Company\u2019s website, and in press statements and other communications. The Company also pursues environmental and other goals and initiatives that involve risks and uncertainties, require investments, and depend in part on third-party performance or data that is outside the Company\u2019s control, and the Company may not be able to fully achieve all of its goals and initiatives. Efforts by the Company to advance its business and values, or achieve its goals and further its initiatives, or to align with stakeholders\u2019 expectations, or comply with evolving, varied and at times conflicting federal, state and international laws, executive orders, regulations and standards, or any failure or perceived failure to do so, can result in adverse reactions by consumers and other stakeholders, including the commencement of legal and regulatory proceedings against the Company, and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 13 The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties. From time to time, the Company has made changes to its business, including actions taken in response to litigation, competition, market conditions and legal and regulatory requirements. The Company expects to make further business changes in the future. For example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps on the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms and is currently subject to a court order preventing it from imposing any commission or fee on certain purchases that consumers make. Globally, several jurisdictions have adopted, or may in the future adopt, competition-related laws and regulations imposing wide-ranging obligations on technology companies and significant limitations on businesses, including the Company. For example, the Company has implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari \u00ae in the EU as it seeks to comply with the Digital Markets Act (\u201cDMA\u201d), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods of distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company\u2019s operating systems, and additional tools and application programming interfaces for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company\u2019s compliance plan is intended to address the DMA\u2019s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private litigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. While the changes introduced by the Company in the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain. Changes to the Company\u2019s business in response to the DMA or other laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact",

The Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can result in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the Company is subject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of investigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are resolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes to its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become subject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements with Google LLC (\u201cGoogle\u201d) and other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications, and certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024, Google was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws. In connection with this finding, on September 2, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (\u201cD.C. District Court\u201d) ordered certain remedies. The court\u2019s order is subject to further proceedings before the D.C. District Court, which may result in changes to the interpretation or application of the remedies ordered by the court, as well as new or changed remedies being ordered. The court\u2019s order is also subject to appeal by both the U.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and Google. A reversal of the order on appeal could result in imposition of certain remedies initially proposed by the DOJ, such as those prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search distribution. If implemented, these remedies could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to earn revenue from such licensing arrangements. The Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially adversely affected, individually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the future. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with legal proceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security. Such changes in business practices can also otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, lost sales, and lower profit margins. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 14 The Company\u2019s business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws, rules, policies and other obligations regarding the collection, use, protection and transfer of personal data. The Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, protection and transfer of various types of personal data. In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also restrict transfers of personal data among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed laws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing requirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to change its business practices. Noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability. The Company makes statements about its use and disclosure of personal data through its privacy policy, information provided on its website, press statements and other privacy notices provided to customers. Any failure or perceived failure by the Company to comply with these public statements or with federal, state or international privacy or data protection laws and regulations could result in inquiries, proceedings and penalties from governmental entities or others. Such a failure or perceived failure could also result in reputational impacts, ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The risks of inadvertent disclosure of personal data can increase with the introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, further exacerbating such risks. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, protection and transfer of personal data, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to the collection and processing of data associated with minors, as well as information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as",

The risks of inadvertent disclosure of personal data can increase with the introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, further exacerbating such risks. In addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, protection and transfer of personal data, the Company is also subject to specific obligations relating to the collection and processing of data associated with minors, as well as information considered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health, biometric, financial and payment card data. Health, biometric, financial and payment card data are subject to additional privacy, security and breach notification requirements, and the Company is subject to audit by governmental authorities regarding the Company\u2019s compliance with these obligations. If the Company fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, the Company can be subject to litigation or government investigations, can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can incur significant fees or fines. The Company is also subject to new and changing laws and regulations regarding online safety, including enhanced protections for minors and mandatory age verification requirements. These laws and regulations can increase regulatory risks by requiring complex compliance measures and significant modifications to the Company\u2019s products, services and operations, and may lead to operational disruptions, heightened privacy and data security risks, increased costs and potential liability and fines, all of which can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Financial Risks The Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors. The Company\u2019s gross margins vary significantly across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels and can change over time. The Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the Company may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand for certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of components, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the Company\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the geographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product and service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new or increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the introduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the Company generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product could significantly impact net sales and gross margins. The Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to local currencies. The Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost of sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing demand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to raise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross margins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15 Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, while generally beneficial to the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, could cause the Company to reduce international pricing or incur losses on its foreign currency derivative instruments, thereby limiting the benefit. Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may increase the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins. The Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The use of such hedging activities may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. The Company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the values of its investment portfolio. The Company\u2019s investments can be negatively affected by changes in liquidity, credit deterioration, financial results, market and economic conditions, political risk, sovereign risk, interest rate fluctuations or other factors. As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially.",

As a result, the value and liquidity of the Company\u2019s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities may fluctuate substantially. Although the Company has not realized significant losses on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, future fluctuations in their value could result in significant losses and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. The Company is exposed to credit risk on its trade accounts receivable, vendor non-trade receivables and prepayments related to long-term supply agreements, and this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen. The Company distributes its products and certain of its services through third-party cellular network carriers and other resellers. The Company also sells its products and services directly to small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. A substantial majority of the Company\u2019s outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral, third-party bank support or financing arrangements, or credit insurance, and a significant portion of the Company\u2019s trade receivables can be concentrated within cellular network carriers or other resellers. The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and collectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-trade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with long-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\u2019s vendor non-trade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. The Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to additional tax liabilities. The Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a number of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income taxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the introduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of new taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant judgment and be subject to differing interpretations. The Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is inherently uncertain. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16 General Risks The price of the Company\u2019s stock is subject to volatility. The Company\u2019s stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the technology industry and the stock market as a whole have, from time to time, experienced extreme stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance. Price volatility may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock in a given period to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. The Company believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. The Company also believes the price of its stock should reflect expectations that its cash dividend will continue at current levels or grow, and that its current share repurchase program will be fully consummated. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d), and the Company\u2019s share repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, share repurchases or other market expectations, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.",

Cybersecurity The Company\u2019s management, led by its Head of Corporate Information Security, has overall responsibility for identifying, assessing and managing any material risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company\u2019s Head of Corporate Information Security leads a dedicated Information Security team of highly skilled individuals with experience across industries that, among other things, develops and distributes information security policies, standards and procedures; engages in employee cybersecurity training; implements security controls; assesses security risk and compliance posture; monitors and responds to security events; and executes security testing and assessments. The Company\u2019s Head of Corporate Information Security has extensive knowledge and skills gained from over 25 years of experience in the cybersecurity industry, including serving in leadership positions at other large technology companies and leading the Company\u2019s Information Security team since 2016. The Company\u2019s Information Security team coordinates with teams across the Company to prevent, respond to and manage security incidents, and engages third parties, as appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of its security processes and incident response . A dedicated Supplier Trust team manages information security risks the Company is exposed to through its supplier relationships. The Company has processes to log, track, address, and escalate for further assessment and report, as appropriate, cybersecurity incidents across the Company and its suppliers to senior management and the Audit and Finance Committee (\u201cAudit Committee\u201d) of the Board. The Company\u2019s enterprise risk management program is designed to identify, asse ss, and monitor the Company\u2019s business risks, including financial, operational, compliance and reputational risks, and reflects management\u2019s assessment of cybersecurity risks. The Audit Committee assists the Board in the oversight and monitoring of cybersecurity matters. The Audit Committee regularly reviews and discusses the Company\u2019s cybersecurity risks with management , including the Company\u2019s Head of Corporate Information Security, its General Counsel and the Heads of Compliance and Business Conduct, Business Assurance, and Internal Audit, and receives updates, as necessary, regarding cybersecurity incidents. The Chair of the Audit Committee regularly reports the substance of such reviews and discussions to the Board, as necessary, and recommends to the Board such actions as the Audit Committee deems appropriate.

    "text": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings Digital Markets Act Investigations On March 25, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened a formal noncompliance investigation against the Company under Article 5(4) of the EU DMA (\u201cArticle 5(4) Investigation\u201d). The Article 5(4) Investigation relates to how developers may communicate and promote offers to end users for apps distributed through the App Store, as well as how developers may conclude contracts with those end users. On June 24, 2024, the Commission announced that it had opened an additional formal investigation against the Company regarding whether the Company\u2019s new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app marketplaces may violate the DMA (\u201cArticle 6(4) Investigation\u201d). On April 23, 2025, the Commission fined the Company \u20ac500 million in the Article 5(4) Investigation and issued a cease and desist order requiring the Company to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. The Company has appealed the Commission\u2019s Article 5(4) decision. Also on April 23, 2025, the Commission issued preliminary findings in the Article 6(4) Investigation. If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4) Investigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the Company\u2019s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company has violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes to its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Department of Justice Lawsuit On March 21, 2024, the DOJ and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress the alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the U.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The Company believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself. Epic Games Epic Games, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (\u201cCalifornia District Court\u201d) against the Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the Company\u2019s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Review Guidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the \u201c2021 Injunction\u201d) enjoining the Company from prohibiting developers from including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than the Company\u2019s in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S. storefronts of the iOS and iPadOS App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the 2021 Injunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a motion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30, 2025, the California District Court found the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee on purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide consumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer\u2019s choice to proceed in or out of an app. The California District Court also denied the Company\u2019s motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District Court\u2019s most recent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (\u201cNinth Circuit Court\u201d). Although the Company\u2019s request to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to consider the Company\u2019s appeal on an expedited basis, with oral arguments heard in October 2025. Other Legal Proceedings The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This Item generally discusses 2025 and 2024 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2025 and 2024. Discussions of 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023 are not included, and can be found in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024. Product, Service and Software Announcements The Company announces new product, service and software offerings at various times during the year. Significant announcements during fiscal year 2025 included the following: First Quarter 2025: \u2022 MacBook Pro \u2022 Mac mini \u2022 iMac \u2022 iPad mini Second Quarter 2025: \u2022 iPhone 16e \u2022 iPad Air \u2022 iPad \u2022 MacBook Air \u2022 Mac Studio Third Quarter 2025: \u2022 iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, visionOS 26 and tvOS 26 Fourth Quarter 2025: \u2022 iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max \u2022 Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3 and Apple Watch Ultra 3 \u2022 AirPods Pro 3 Fiscal Period The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Macroeconomic Conditions Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 21 Tariffs and Other Measures Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new U.S. Tariffs were announced, including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the EU, among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports from the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended, into, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products, including downstream products that contain semiconductors. Tariffs and other measures that are applied to the Company\u2019s products or their components can have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition, including impacting the Company\u2019s supply chain, the availability of rare earths and other raw materials and components, pricing and gross margin. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several factors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent other countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these measures. Trade and other international disputes can have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in consumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which can further adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Segment Operating Performance The following table shows net sales by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions): 2025 Change 2024 Change 2023 Americas $ 178,353 7 % $ 167,045 3 % $ 162,560 Europe 111,032 10 % 101,328 7 % 94,294 Greater China 64,377 (4) % 66,952 (8) % 72,559 Japan 28,703 15 % 25,052 3 % 24,257 Rest of Asia Pacific 33,696 10 % 30,658 4 % 29,615 Total net sales $ 416,161 6 % $ 391,035 2 % $ 383,285 Americas Americas net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of iPhone and Services. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact on Americas net sales during 2025. Europe Europe net sales increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to higher net sales of Services, iPhone and Mac. Greater China Greater China net sales decreased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to lower net sales of iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Mac.

Services gross margin percentage increased during 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to a different mix of services, partially offset by higher costs. The Company\u2019s future gross margins can be impacted by a variety of factors, as discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d As a result, the Company believes, in general, gross margins will be subject to volatility and downward pressure.

Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 24 Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes, effective tax rate and statutory federal income tax rate for 2025, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2025 2024 2023 Provision for income taxes $ 20,719 $ 29,749 $ 16,741 Effective tax rate 15.6 % 24.1 % 14.7 % Statutory federal income tax rate 21 % 21 % 21 % The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2025 was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate primarily due to a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings, including the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, the impact of the U.S. federal R&D credit, and tax benefits from share-based compensation, partially offset by a change in valuation allowance and state income taxes. The Company\u2019s effective tax rate for 2025 was lower compared to 2024 due to a $10.7 billion year-over-year decrease in the provision for income taxes related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) and the impact of changes in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by a change in valuation allowance and a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Internal-Use Software In September 2025, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2025-06, Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other\u2014Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Internal-Use Software (\u201cASU 2025-06\u201d), which modernizes the accounting for internal-use software. ASU 2025-06 removes all references to software development stages and requires capitalization of software costs when management has committed to the software project and it is probable the software will be completed and perform its intended use. ASU 2025-06 will be effective for the Company in its first quarter of 2029, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and method of its adoption of ASU 2025-06. Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement\u2014Reporting Comprehensive Income\u2014Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (\u201cASU 2024-03\u201d) and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-01, Income Statement\u2014Reporting Comprehensive Income\u2014Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date , which clarified the effective date of ASU 2024-03. ASU 2024-03 will require the Company to disclose the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization, as applicable, included in certain expense captions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as well as qualitatively describe remaining amounts included in those captions. ASU 2024-03 will also require the Company to disclose both the amount and the Company\u2019s definition of selling expenses. The Company will adopt ASU 2024-03 in its fourth quarter of 2028 using a prospective transition method. Income Taxes In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-09\u201d), which will require the Company to disclose specified additional information in its income tax rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 will also require the Company to disaggregate its income taxes paid disclosure by federal, state and foreign taxes, with further disaggregation required for significant individual jurisdictions. The Company will adopt ASU 2023-09 in its fourth quarter of 2026 using a prospective transition method. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and the Company\u2019s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\u2019s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.

Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Uncertain Tax Positions The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. The evaluation of the Company\u2019s uncertain tax positions involves significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws, including the TCJA and the allocation of international taxation rights between countries. Although management believes the Company\u2019s reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these uncertainties will not be different from that reflected in the Company\u2019s reserves. Reserves are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 26 Legal and Other Contingencies The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, the outcomes of which are inherently uncertain. The Company records a liability when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner inconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.",

    "text": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies to manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Interest Rate Risk The Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase the interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios. The following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any associated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (dollars in millions): Interest Rate Sensitive Instrument Hypothetical Interest Rate Increase Potential Impact 2025 2024 Investment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 2,416 $ 2,755 Term debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 129 $ 139 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk The Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair values of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use derivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company may choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or prohibitive cost. The Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates. Based on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $590 million and $538 million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying foreign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 \u2013 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Preparation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the notes to consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period\u2019s presentation. The Company\u2019s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company\u2019s fiscal years 2025 and 2024 spanned 52 weeks each, whereas fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Segment Reporting Beginning with the 2025 annual reporting period, the Company adopted the FASB\u2019s ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-07\u201d), which requires the Company to disclose segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company\u2019s chief operating decision maker (\u201cCODM\u201d). In addition, ASU 2023-07 requires the Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 using a retrospective transition method. Revenue The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities. Share-Based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest. Cash Equivalents All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents. Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at transaction price. Marketable Securities The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Inventories Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.

Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 34 Derivative Instruments The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Income Taxes The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the TCJA. Leases The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for leases of corporate and retail facilities. Note 2 \u2013 Revenue The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled when control of products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable. The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud \u00ae , Siri \u00ae and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services. For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.

As of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the Company had total deferred revenue of $ 13.7 billion and $ 12.8 billion, respectively. As of September 27, 2025, the Company expects 66 % of total deferred revenue to be realized in less than a year, 23 % within one-to-two years, 9 % within two-to-three years and 2 % in greater than three years.

(2) As of September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents included $ 2.6 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted cash and cash equivalents were designated to settle the Company\u2019s obligation related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d). (3) As of September 28, 2024, current marketable securities included $ 13.2 billion held in escrow and restricted from general use. These restricted marketable securities were designated to settle the Company\u2019s obligation related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 7, \u201cIncome Taxes\u201d). Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 37 As of September 27, 2025, 80 % of the Company\u2019s non-current marketable debt securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 15 % between 5 and 10 years, and 5 % greater than 10 years. As of September 27, 2025, 13 % of the Company\u2019s non-current mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 14 % between 5 and 10 years, and 73 % greater than 10 years. The Company\u2019s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument\u2019s underlying maturity. Derivative Instruments and Hedging The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation. Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss). Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 27, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency transactions is 17 years. The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Interest Rate Risk To protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 38 The notional amounts of the Company\u2019s outstanding derivative instruments as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, were as follows (in millions): 2025 2024 Derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 62,647 $ 64,069 Interest rate contracts $ 12,875 $ 14,575 Derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges: Foreign exchange contracts $ 109,079 $ 91,493 As of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the carrying amount of the Company\u2019s current and non-current term debt subject to fair value hedges was $ 12.6 billion and $ 13.5 billion, respectively.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related final products are sold by the Company.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (\u201cGeneral Court\u201d). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the Commission appealed the General Court\u2019s decision to the European Court of Justice (\u201cECJ\u201d). On September 10, 2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the Commission\u2019s 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax charge of $ 10.2 billion, net, which represented $ 15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of amounts held in escrow, partially offset by a U.S. foreign tax credit of $ 4.8 billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $ 823 million.

Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 41 Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 27, 2025, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 23.2 billion, of which $ 10.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $ 22.0 billion, of which $ 10.8 billion, if recognized, would have impacted the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, for 2025, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in millions): 2025 2024 2023 Beginning balances $ 22,038 $ 19,454 $ 16,758 Increases related to tax positions taken during a prior year 1,971 1,727 2,044 Decreases related to tax positions taken during a prior year ( 71 ) ( 386 ) ( 1,463 ) Increases related to tax positions taken during the current year 3,795 2,542 2,628 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 2,939 ) ( 1,070 ) ( 19 ) Decreases related to expiration of the statute of limitations ( 1,552 ) ( 229 ) ( 494 ) Ending balances $ 23,242 $ 22,038 $ 19,454 The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions.

RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years , based on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company\u2019s common stock on a one -for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022. Restricted Stock Units A summary of the Company\u2019s RSU activity and related information for 2025 is as follows: Number of RSUs (in thousands) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per RSU Balance as of September 28, 2024 163,326 $ 158.73 RSUs granted 73,466 $ 226.68 RSUs vested ( 76,845 ) $ 159.85 RSUs forfeited ( 8,373 ) $ 183.03 Balance as of September 27, 2025 151,574 $ 189.75 The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted in 2024 and 2023 was $ 173.78 and $ 150.87 , respectively. The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant. The total vesting-date fair value of RSUs was $ 17.1 billion, $ 15.8 billion and $ 15.9 billion for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in 2025, 2024 and 2023 were net share settled such that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees\u2019 obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. Total payments to taxing authorities for employees\u2019 tax obligations were $ 6.1 billion in 2025 and $ 5.6 billion in both 2024 and 2023.

Therefore, many components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

When a component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 46 Note 13 \u2013 Segment Information and Geographic Data The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\u2019s CEO is its CODM. The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The CODM uses segment net sales and operating income information to make certain decisions, such as product and service pricing, and to decide how to allocate resources related to sales activities and marketing investments. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company\u2019s retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the CODM for purposes of making decisions and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated October 31, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Uncertain Tax Positions Description of the Matter As discussed in Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. As of September 27, 2025, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $23.2 billion, of which $10.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company\u2019s effective tax rate. In accounting for some of the uncertain tax positions, the Company uses significant judgment in the interpretation and application of GAAP and complex domestic and international tax laws. Auditing management\u2019s evaluation of whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex, involves significant judgment, and is based on interpretations of tax laws. Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 49 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We tested controls relating to the evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including controls over management\u2019s assessment as to whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, management\u2019s process to measure the benefit of its tax positions that qualify for recognition, and the related disclosures.

San Jose, California October 31, 2025 Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 50 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Apple Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Apple Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the \u201cCOSO criteria\u201d). In our opinion, Apple Inc. (the \u201cCompany\u201d) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated October 31, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP San Jose, California October 31, 2025 Apple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 51",

    "text": "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 27, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Inherent Limitations over Internal Controls The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company\u2019s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Management, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s assessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 27, 2025 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2025, which were identified in connection with management\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.
